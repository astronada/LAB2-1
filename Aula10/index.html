          <p>Mon 18 December 2017</p>
          <p>This weekend I did some experiments with my Raspberry Pi. I'm still using the first generation model B which only has 256MB of RAM. When I purchased the board I bought it with a 4GB card. Which was at that time sufficient for both a
            headless and desktop installation </p>

          <p>Mon 18 December 2017</p>
          <p>This battery powered wireless charging lantern will glow for 1.5 hours on a single charge. It works with a handful of electronic parts and a USB charger. The USB cable plugs into the base, and the lamp sits on the base and charges
            through induction, which we'll get into later. </p>
