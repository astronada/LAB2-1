Interview with Mark Ryden

"The Nutcracker" may be the ballet with the best-known world of candy, but American Ballet Theatre is upping the delicious factor with its new dessert-themed ballet "Whipped Cream."

A two-act ballet titled Whipped Cream premiered at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa, California, on March 2017, for which Ryden developed costumes and sets. The ballet was created by world-renowned choreographer Alexei Ratmansky for the American Ballet Theatre.

It is a story about a young boy who overindulges at a Vienna pastry shop and falls into a surreal delirium. With libretto and music by Richard Strauss, the ballet, originally titled Schlagobers, was first performed by the Vienna State Opera in 1924.

“It just seemed like an exciting adventure,” Ryden says of why he was drawn to the project. “And it hit at the right time for me. I’d just finished a series of art shows, and this seemed like something different. Just bringing the other dimensions beyond a static painting — story, action, movement, music, all those things.”

The result is an explosion of fantasy, surrealism and traditional ballet — “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” meets “Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children” meets “The Nutcracker.”
